# Student Registration
This is a very project for keeping informations of students.
- It can store different informations of students. (As an example we used id, name, email, image)
- Only someone from the authority can add students.
- Anyone can see the informations of a student by providing his id
- Anyone can see that which address is the address of the authority (That means the address which has the access of adding a new student)

It is the back-end of the this very basic project.
